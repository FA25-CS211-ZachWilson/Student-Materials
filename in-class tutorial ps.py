Write a simple Python program that:
- Asks the user to input their name, age, GPA, and whether they are a full-time student (yes/no).
- Stores each piece of information in a variable of the appropriate type (str, int, float, bool).
- Prints out a summary of the student’s information, nicely formatted.
- (Pracice Using AI): If the user is a full-time student and their GPA is above 3.5, print a congratulatory message.
