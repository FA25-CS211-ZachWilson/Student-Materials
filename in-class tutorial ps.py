# Algorithm Problems (Write Python code)

# 1. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.

# 2. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order, otherwise False.

# 3. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared.



# Pseudocode Problems (Write in pseudocode, not Python)

# 4. Write pseudocode for an algorithm that finds the second largest number in a list.

# 5. Write pseudocode for an algorithm that reverses a list.

# 6. Write pseudocode for an algorithm that finds the average (mean) of a list of numbers.
